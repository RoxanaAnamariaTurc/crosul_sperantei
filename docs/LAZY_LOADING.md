# Image Lazy Loading Implementation

## Overview

The previous events section now uses lazy loading to improve performance and reduce initial load times. This is especially beneficial since there are 26 images in the continuously scrolling section.

## Features

### LazyImage Component (`app/_components/LazyImage.tsx`)

- **Progressive Loading**: Images load only when needed
- **Intersection Observer**: Uses native browser APIs for web to detect when images enter viewport
- **Placeholder Support**: Shows loading indicators while images load
- **Error Handling**: Displays error states for failed image loads
- **Performance Tracking**: Integrates with performance monitoring system

### Performance Monitoring (`app/utils/imagePerformance.ts`)

- **Load Time Tracking**: Measures total time to load all images
- **Memory Usage**: Logs memory consumption on web platforms
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors loading progress across all images
- **Image Caching**: Prevents duplicate loads of the same images

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Initial Load**: Only loads images that are visible or about to be visible
- **Bandwidth Savings**: Especially beneficial for mobile users
- **Memory Efficiency**: Images load progressively rather than all at once
- **Smooth Animations**: Prevents janky scrolling during initial load

### Platform Optimizations

- **Web**: Uses Intersection Observer API for efficient viewport detection
- **Mobile**: Implements progressive loading with randomized delays to spread load

## Implementation Details

### Previous Events Section

```tsx
// Before: All 26 images loaded immediately
<Animated.Image source={event.image} style={styles.previousEventImage} />

// After: Images load progressively as needed
<LazyImage
  source={event.image}
  style={styles.previousEventImage}
  threshold={150} // Start loading 150px before entering viewport
  placeholder={<CustomPlaceholder />}
/>
```

### Performance Tracking

```tsx
// Initialize tracking
imagePerformance.startTracking(previousEventsData.length);

// Each image reports when loaded
imagePerformance.onImageLoaded();

// Get progress information
const progress = imagePerformance.getProgress();
```

## Configuration

### Lazy Loading Thresholds

- **Previous Events**: 150px threshold (balanced between performance and user experience)
- **Featured Events**: No lazy loading (critical content that should load immediately)

### Loading Strategy

- **Web**: Intersection Observer with configurable root margin
- **Mobile**: Progressive loading with 0-2 second random delays to spread network requests

## Monitoring

### Console Logs

- Image loading completion times
- Memory usage statistics (web only)
- Loading progress updates

### Performance Marks (Web)

- `image-loading-start`: When image loading begins
- `image-loading-end`: When all images are loaded
- `image-loading-duration`: Total loading time measurement

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Image Resizing**: Serve different image sizes based on device/screen size
2. **WebP Support**: Use modern image formats when supported
3. **Preloading**: Implement intelligent preloading of next likely-to-be-viewed images
4. **Network-Aware Loading**: Adjust loading strategy based on connection speed
5. **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large image sets, implement virtual scrolling

### Additional Features

- **Blur-to-Clear Effect**: Show low-quality blur version while loading high-quality image
- **Skeleton Loading**: More sophisticated placeholder animations
- **Priority Loading**: Load images in order of importance/visibility
